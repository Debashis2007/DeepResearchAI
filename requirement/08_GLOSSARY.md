# 📖 Glossary

## Deep Research AI System

---

## A

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of protocols and tools for building software applications. APIs define how different software components should interact.

### Async/Asynchronous
Programming paradigm where operations can run independently without blocking the main execution thread.

---

## C

### Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
A reasoning technique where the model breaks down complex problems into sequential steps, showing its reasoning process explicitly.

### Citation
A reference to a source of information, including details like author, title, URL, and date accessed.

### Confidence Score
A numerical value (typically 0-1 or 0-100%) indicating how certain the system is about a particular finding or claim.

### Context Window
The maximum amount of text (measured in tokens) that an LLM can process in a single request.

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
A security feature that allows or restricts resources on a web page to be requested from another domain.

---

## D

### Dead Letter Queue
A queue that stores messages that cannot be processed successfully, for later analysis or retry.

### Decomposition (Query)
The process of breaking down a complex query into smaller, more manageable sub-queries.

---

## E

### Embedding
A numerical vector representation of text that captures semantic meaning, enabling similarity comparisons.

### Entity
A specific person, place, organization, concept, or thing identified in text.

### Exponential Backoff
A retry strategy where the wait time between retries increases exponentially with each attempt.

---

## F

### Fallback
An alternative action or resource used when the primary option fails.

### FastAPI
A modern, high-performance Python web framework for building APIs.

---

## G

### Graceful Degradation
A design approach where a system continues to operate with reduced functionality when parts of it fail.

---

## H

### Hallucination
Content generated by an AI that is not grounded in the source material or factual reality.

### Health Check
An endpoint or process that verifies a system is functioning correctly.

### Horizontal Scaling
Adding more machines or instances to handle increased load, as opposed to vertical scaling (adding more power to existing machines).

---

## I

### Intent
The underlying goal or purpose behind a user's query.

---

## J

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
A lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse.

---

## L

### LangChain
A framework for developing applications powered by language models, providing tools for chaining LLM calls with other components.

### LLM (Large Language Model)
An AI model trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text. Examples: GPT-4, Claude.

### LlamaIndex
A data framework for LLM applications, focused on connecting LLMs with external data sources.

---

## M

### Markdown
A lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using plain text syntax.

### Metadata
Data that provides information about other data, such as source URL, retrieval date, or author information.

---

## N

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
A field of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

---

## O

### OpenAPI (Swagger)
A specification for describing REST APIs, enabling automatic documentation and client generation.

### Orchestration
The coordination and management of multiple services or components to work together.

---

## P

### PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
Any data that could potentially identify a specific individual.

### Prompt
The input text given to an LLM to generate a response.

### Prompt Engineering
The practice of designing and optimizing prompts to get desired outputs from LLMs.

### Provenance
The origin and history of data, tracking where information came from and how it was transformed.

---

## Q

### Query Expansion
A technique that adds related terms or synonyms to a search query to improve results.

---

## R

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
A technique that combines information retrieval with text generation, allowing LLMs to access external knowledge.

### Rate Limiting
Controlling the number of requests a user or system can make within a time period.

### REST (Representational State Transfer)
An architectural style for designing networked applications using standard HTTP methods.

### Retry Mechanism
A strategy for automatically attempting failed operations again after a delay.

---

## S

### Semantic Search
Search that understands the meaning and context of queries, not just keyword matching.

### Source Credibility
A measure of how trustworthy and reliable an information source is.

### Streaming
Delivering data in a continuous flow rather than waiting for complete results.

### Structured Output
Data organized in a predefined format (like JSON) rather than free-form text.

### Sub-query
A smaller, focused query derived from decomposing a complex question.

### Synthesis
The process of combining information from multiple sources into a coherent whole.

---

## T

### Tavily
A search API optimized for AI agents and research applications.

### Token
The basic unit of text processing in LLMs, roughly equivalent to 4 characters or 0.75 words in English.

### TTL (Time To Live)
The duration for which cached data is considered valid before it expires.

---

## U

### URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
A string that identifies a resource, including URLs.

---

## V

### Vector Database
A database optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors (embeddings).

### Verification Loop
A process that checks and validates AI-generated content against sources.

---

## W

### WebSocket
A protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time updates.
