# 📋 Project Overview

## Project 4: Deep Research AI with Web Search & Reasoning

---

## 1. Purpose & Objective

The objective of this project is to design and build an **AI-powered Deep Research System** that can:

* Understand complex research queries
* Search the web intelligently
* Reason over multiple sources
* Verify information
* Produce structured, trustworthy research outputs

This system mimics the behavior of advanced research assistants (e.g., Perplexity, Deep Research agents) by combining **LLMs, web search, reasoning frameworks, and verification loops**.

## 2. Scope

### In Scope

* Multi-step reasoning using LLMs
* External web search integration
* Source retrieval and citation
* Verification and self-correction
* Structured research output generation

### Out of Scope

* Model pretraining from scratch
* Real-time streaming UI (optional)
* Autonomous long-running agents (beyond controlled loops)
